# Concentration Memory Game

## User Story

- As a player, I want to play the memory game so that I can see how high a score I can get from remembering the increasing sequence of the characters movements.

- As a player, I want to see a landing page with a colorful graphic and title when I arrive at the website to know I'm in the right place.

- As a player, I want to see a clearly labelled start button on the landing page, so I instantly know how to start the game.

- As a player, I want to see a visual represenation and audio representation that the game has started, with timer showing game duration.

- As a player, I want to easily be able to see the movement and hear the sound of the game characters, so I'm able to know the sequence.

- As a player, I want to easily know when the movement and sequence of the characters has ended and when it is my turn to select my game move.

- As a player, I want visual and audio feedback while selecting my move so I know my choice has been registered.

- As a player, I want visual and audio feedback if while selecting my move, if I've correctly selected the previous sequence shown.

- As a player, I want to see a visual score display that increases for every sequence iteration that I've correctly chosen.

- As a player, I want visual and audio feedback if while selecting my move, if I've incorrectly selected the previous sequence shown.

- As a player, I want to be presented with a clear message when I've lost the game by incorrectly selecting the previous sequence and for my current score to be displayed; with the highest score achieved next to it.

- As a player, I want a option (button) to play another round to try and improve my score.

## Description

This project has been to develop a browser based game with win/loss logic, win/loss messages rendered in HTML, and DOM manipulation techniques. The game involves 8 animals from across the world. The idea behind the game is to correctly remember and input the sequence of the animals movement for as long as possible. I chose to develop a concentration (memory) game due to enjoying playing them when I was in secondary school.

## Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

The time frame given for the project was one week and we were instructed to work indepentently on this task.

## Technologies Used 

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Brief

The brief given for the Concentration (memory) game was: 

- The game must be deployed online for the rest of the world to play.
- That it must have a theme.
- The player must lose after a certain amount of time has passed.
- CSS Flexbox and/or Grid must be used for page layout design.
- Instructions for how to play the game must be included.
- Colours used on the site must have appropriate contrast (WCAG 2.0 level AA standard).
- All images on site have alt text.
- No text is placed on top of an image in a way that makes the text inaccessible.
- No errors encounted when playing game (no errors present in console).
- Code in the app adheres to coding conventions covered in lessons.
- No remaining dead and/or commented out code or console logs outside of a commented out Code Graveyard section of your code.
- No 'prompt()' or 'alert()' methods utilized in game.
- Proper indentation coded in game.
- Game must be rendered in browser using DOM manipulation techniques.
- Includes win/loss logic and renders win/loss messages in HTML.
- Includes seperate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JavaScript data files organised in an appropriate directory structure.

## Planning

- Online concentration games were played to see different examples and to understand the logic behind this type of game.
- Pseudocode was used in the JavaScript file to organise how to write the code for the project.
